# VQA-using-Mask-Scoring-RCNN-and-Attention-Mechanism
This repository contains the implementation of a Visual Question Answering (VQA) system utilizing Mask Scoring RCNN for instance segmentation and incorporating attention mechanisms to prioritize relevant visual features during question answering.

# Overview
Visual Question Answering (VQA) is a challenging task that requires understanding both visual content and textual questions. This project aims to enhance VQA performance by integrating state-of-the-art techniques in instance segmentation and attention mechanisms.

# Features
Utilizes Mask Scoring RCNN for accurate instance segmentation, enabling precise identification of objects in images.
Integrates attention mechanisms to prioritize relevant visual features during question answering, improving the model's ability to focus on important image regions.
Implements a deep learning architecture combining convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for image processing and recurrent neural networks (RNNs) for textual processing.
Provides training scripts, evaluation metrics, and pre-trained models for easy experimentation and deployment.
